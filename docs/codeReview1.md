| Item | Considerations | Comments/Suggestions | 
|------|------------|----------|
| Problem Statement | 1. Accurately describes project purpose2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.3. Fully explains the problem and the solution4. Is understandable by the average person | Great idea. Great job walking us through your problem statement and how you plan to solve it. I like the idea of using the spoonacular.com API to find recipes that other users have entered.
| Design Documentation | 1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use.2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | Great use of user stories and screen designs to walk us through your project. It was logical and easy to understand.
| Data model/Database | 1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.3. The model represents good database design | Alex did show us the different classes he had written up, as well as the DAOs for each of those classes. All the requirements for the database were present; the database layout itself looked clean and organized.
| Code | 1. Proper Maven project structure is used2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages. | There was no redundant code. Classes are appropriately-sized, clean and easy to follow.
