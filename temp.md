|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|1. Accurately describes project purpose|
|2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.
|3. Fully explains the problem and the solution
|4. Is understandable by the average person|The Problem Statement was easy to read and understand, and it presented a very useful application. Looking forward to the final version!||Design Documentation|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use.
|2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use
|3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use
|4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens |The user stories in particular were very well-written, and stepped us through the app handily.||Data model/Database|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model
|2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.
|3. The model represents good database design
|All the requirements for the database were present; the database layout itself was very impressive. I learned about a few other tools which I was not aware of during the presentation.||Code|1. Proper Maven project structure is used
|2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented
|3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes
|4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)
|Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values
|5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.
|6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.|I didn't look closely enough to notice any redundancies; the code I did see was concise and well documented. Again, found about a few tools I was unaware of before. I think it will be a well-running and interesting application when it is done. The code that was there (which was quite a bit) all ran cleanly and showed what the final app will look like.|
